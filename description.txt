	I wanted to develop a role playing game (RPG) using C# and the unity game engine. It's been quite a challenge, but I enjoy it. Before I started this project I didn't realize just how much effort goes into creating an RPG. Below is a prototype of what I've been working on, and you can play it in your web browser on itch.io <a class="hover:bg-yellow-300 hover:text-slate-900 rounded" target="_blank" href="https://dwarvengames.itch.io/rpg-prototype"><u>Here</u></a>.

	The assets featured in this game are from Pixel-Boy's <a class="hover:bg-yellow-300 hover:text-slate-900 rounded" target="_blank" href="https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack"><u>Ninja Adventure</u></a> asset pack.
