	I wanted to develop a role playing game (RPG) using C# and the unity game engine. It's been quite a challenge, but I enjoy it. Before I started this project I didn't realize just how much effort goes into creating an RPG. Below is a prototype of what I've been working on, and you can play it in your web browser on itch.io <a class="text-blue-500 underline" target="_blank" href=https://dwarvengames.itch.io/rpg-prototype/>Here</a>.

	The assets featured in this game are from Pixel-Boy's <a class="text-blue-500 underline" target="_blank" href=https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack/>Ninja Adventure</a> asset pack.
